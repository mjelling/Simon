//the first step is to create the arrays that will have the possible sequences for each level
//create a variable that uses Math.random() and math,floor() to create an integer to select from the nested arrays.
//create a function that animates the four boxes, that can be used again and again through out the game, this function will need a for loop that will respond to the different length of arrays
//prompt user to click on the elements in the right order based on what has just been given
//click animates elements the same way as before
//log click events, push them into an array, check the new array against the old array
//if the arrays match, change color background, and add the level before to the UL list
//if you lose alert the player they have lost, ask if they want to play again, if no, return to page with one levels on it, if yes reload original page.
