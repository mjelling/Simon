Story 1:
  Working in a cubicle is tough. I really loved playing Hasbro's simon with my brothers and sisters as a kid. Theres now a site where I can play the computer.
  The color blocks are just like the original. These move with animation, but I especially love the unique tones. I feel like I'm ten again.

Story 2:
  My kids drive me crazy. With the new Simon game, they stay busy for hours. I'm just surprised I pick it up when they go to sleep!
