A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

technologies used:
  html(including audio feature)
  css
  javascript
  jquery
  googlefonts
  Within the scripts page the following is used:
    variable declarations
    animation
    audio pulls from html
    click handlers
    nested functions
    for loops
    while loops
    if else statements
    jquery
      jquery selectors, jquery function, jquery onload function

This game is largely based on the generation, manipulation, and comparison of arrays. Click handlers launch the necessary functions at the right time, allowing for players to play the game at their own pace. Counters are used to keep track of the player's level and the number of elements that are pushed to the random array on which each level is based. I used audio files, and animation in conjuction in order to reproduce the features of the original game, creating identical effects for the computer generated move and the player move. I used jquery element selectors to effect my h3 element, informing the player what level they are on if the game is in motion, of their failure if they could not complete the first level, and a congratulations message if they have made progress through the game.  The function also generates instructions for starting the game anew.

I made use of a google font to give the game some character, and relied heavily on the float effect to create a clean balanced look

Installation instructions:
browser must support html audio

Unsolved problems:
Difficulty with css layout kept me from creating a two player option. When the page's look was trashed by the addition of another 2 buttons, I scrapped the idea.
